# RSpec Example

Source code from my talk "A Little RSpec" given at the 6th Ruby Metup Santiago.
You will need RSpec to run the tests.

Files:

* lib/ninja.rb -> The class being tested

* spec/newbie_ninja_spec.rb -> A spec using basic stuff

* spec/ninja_spec.rb -> A spec using more advanced stuff
